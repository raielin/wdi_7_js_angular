<!-- ng-app says that this is an angular app. -->
<!-- Will now go through and run angular stuff. -->
<!-- This becomes the template -->
<!-- Allows us to have expressions in HTML -->
<body ng-app>

<!-- bind an expression -->
<h1>Welcome {{ 1 + 1 }}</h1>

<!-- bind to a property on the scope object -->
<!-- A scope object is something your view has access to, to interact with data -->
<!-- Can later be bound to a controller -->
<!-- It's a bucket for all of your stuff. -->
<!-- You can use things before you define it. Angular evaulates the whole file first before running it. -->
<!-- Realistically this would all be done -->
<h1>Welcome {{ person.name }}</h1>

<!-- populate the person object on the scope object using ng-init directive -->
<!-- Initializes some data in that scope object. -->
<!-- There's no way to see this object, it's hidden right now. Angular gives it to you. -->
<!-- Removing it doesn't give an error, it just doesn't render b/c it doesn't know what it is. -->
<h1 ng-init="person = {name: 'dan'}">Welcome {{ person.name }}</h1>

<!-- This would override 'dan'. -->
<!-- <h1 ng-init="person = {name: 'joe'}">Welcome {{ person.name }}</h1> -->

<!-- input bound to a property on the scope using ng-model directive -->
<!-- Angular objectives: ng-model, ng-app, ng-init. Gives HTML more ability to do things. -->
<!-- Angular comes built with 2-way data mining. -->
<p><input type="text" ng-model="person.name"></p>
